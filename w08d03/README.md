# W08D03 - End-to-End Testing with Cypress

### To Do
- [x] Jest vs Cypress
- [x] Install and Configure Cypress
- [x] Design End-to-End Tests with Cypress

* Jest
  * command line test runner
  * doesn't start a browser
  * runs very quickly (cheap)
  * typically used for unit and integration
  * testing assertions

* Cypress
  * starts a browser for every test
  * runs very slowly (expensive)
  * rarely test assertions






```js
registerPlayerItem('Axe', setState);

const registerPlayerItem = function(value, updater) {
  updater(prevState => ({ ...prevState, playerSelection: value }));
};
```
