# W04D02 - Client Side JavaScript & jQuery

### To Do
- [x] JavaScript in the Browser
- [x] Browser objects: `window`, `navigator`, `document`, and `event`
- [x] The Document Object Model (DOM)
- [x] Intro to jQuery
- [x] Element creation and DOM manipulation with jQuery
- [x] Event handling with jQuery
- [x] Document ready

### DOM
* Document Object Model
* a type of object (tree)
* HTML => DOM

### Tree
* any node can have an unlimited number of siblings
* any node can have an unlimited number of children
* any node can ONLY have one parent

### Separation of Concerns
* each language is responsible for a different thing
* HTML => markup provides the structure
* CSS => for styling
* JavaScript => DOM manipulation, traversal, event handling, etc...

### CDN
* Content Delivery Network
* browser caches the response


imperative - we explicitly tell the computer what to do
declarative - what we want to happen, but not how to do it


```js
$button.on('click', () => {});
connection.on('data', () => {});
app.get('/users', () => {});
```
